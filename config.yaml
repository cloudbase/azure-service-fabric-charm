options:
  cluster-name:
    type: string
    default: JujuServiceFabric
    description: "Friendly name of the Azure Service Fabric."
  security-type:
    type: string
    default: Unsecure
    description: |
      The type of the cluster security. Supported types by the charm are:
      - 'Unsecure', the cluster is not secured at all;
      - 'Windows', for an Active Directory based security;
      - 'X509', for a certificate-based security.
  reliability-level:
    type: string
    default: Bronze
    description: |
      The reliability level defines the number of copies of the system
      services that can run on the primary nodes of the cluster. This
      increases the reliability of these services and hence the cluster.
      You can set this variable to either Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum
      for 3, 5, 7 or 9 copies of these services respectively.
      Note that since a primary node runs a single copy of the system services,
      you would need a minimum of 3 primary nodes for Bronze, 5 for Silver,
      7 for Gold and 9 for Platinum reliability levels.
  node-type-name:
    type: string
    default: JujuNodeType
    description: "The name of the node type for this deployment"
  fault-domain-name:
    type: string
    default: JujuFD
    description: |
      Represents the fault domain name used for these deployment units.
      A fault domain (FD) is a physical unit of failure and is directly
      related to the physical infrastructure in the data centers. A fault
      domain consists of hardware components (computers, switches, networks,
      and more) that share a single point of failure.
  upgrade-domain-name:
    type: string
    default: JujuUD
    description: |
      An upgrade domain (UD) is a logical unit of nodes. During Service Fabric
      orchestrated upgrades (either an application upgrade or a cluster
      upgrade), all nodes in a UD are taken down to perform the upgrade
      while nodes in other UDs remain available to serve requests.
  client-connection-endpoint-port:
    type: int
    default: 19000
    description: |
      The port used by the client to connect to the cluster, when using
      the client APIs.
  cluster-connection-endpoint-port:
    type: int
    default: 19001
    description: "The port at which the nodes communicate with each other."
  lease-driver-endpoint-port:
    type: int
    default: 19002
    description: |
      The port used by the cluster lease driver to find out if the nodes
      are still active.
  service-connection-endpoint-port:
    type: int
    default: 19003
    description: |
      The port used by the applications and services deployed on a node, to
      communicate with the Service Fabric client on that particular node.
  http-gateway-endpoint-port:
    type: int
    default: 19080
    description: |
      The port used by the Service Fabric Explorer to connect to the cluster.
  ephemeral-start-port:
    type: int
    default: 20606
    description: |
      This is used together with 'ephemeral-end-port'.
      They override the dynamic ports used by the OS. Service Fabric will use
      a part of these as application ports and the remaining will be available
      for the OS.
      You need to make sure that the difference between the start and the end
      ports is at least 255. You may run into conflicts if this difference is
      too low, since this range is shared with the operating system.
  ephemeral-end-port:
    type: int
    default: 20861
    description: |
      This is used together with 'ephemeral-start-port'. They override the
      dynamic ports used by the OS.
  application-start-port:
    type: int
    default: 20575
    description: |
      Starting port that will be used by the Service Fabric applications.
      Config option is used together with 'application-end-port'.
      These should be a subset of the ephemeral ports, enough to cover the
      endpoint requirement of your applications. Service Fabric will use these
      whenever new ports are required, as well as take care of opening
      the firewall for these ports.
  application-end-port:
    type: int
    default: 20605
    description: |
      Ending port that will be used by the Service Fabric applications.
      Config option is used together with 'application-start-port'.
  change-hostname:
    type: boolean
    default: False
    description: |
      The hostname set inside the newly spawned machine is usually the same as
      the name of the instance being spawned. In cases where the instance name
      is larger then 15 characters (maximum size for windows NetBios names), the
      instance name gets truncated to the first 15 characters. This creates a problem,
      as hostnames in active directory, for example, are very important. Having more
      then one machine with the same hostname try to join the same domain, will
      create trust issues.
      This option allows changing the hostname of the current running system to a
      combination of the first 14 (or less, depending on how many digits the unit number has)
      characters of the charm name and the unit number. While this is not infallible,
      It does have less of a chance of creating hostname conflicts.
